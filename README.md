# simulating-data
Programming for Data Analysis project 2020
<br>
# Introduction
This repository contains my project in a jupyter notebook for the module Programming for Data Analysis.
<br>
### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 
Jupyter can also be installed separately from its website.

### Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.
### How do run/save this jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as simulating-data.ipynb (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open CMDER and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the simulating-data.ipynb
- Open file.

# Problem statement
~~~
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.
Specifically, in this project you should:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

# Project:
[simulating-data](https://github.com/AineNicD/simulating-data/blob/main/simulating-data.ipynb)
I have chosen <b>covid-19</b> as my real world phenomenon and basing my dataset on the variables that impact the outcome of contracting the illness, death or recovery based on age, underlying health condition and hospitalisation. 
I used [numpy.random](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) to simulate the data based on research from credible sources such as [The World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1), [health protection surveillance centre](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/casesinireland/) and [cso.ie](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-covid19/covid-19informationhub/health/covid-19deathsandcasesstatistics/)
